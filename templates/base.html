<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity protects data, devices, and networks from potential threats such as hackers, criminals, and malicious code. Layers of protection can include physical security measures, like protecting hardware and servers from unauthorized access, digital defense, like antivirus software, and even employee policies and training, which may be strengthened by providing guidance on creating strong passwords or spotting fraudulent emails.</p>

<p>Today, cybercriminals are using new technologies to their advantage. For instance, businesses are embracing cloud computing for efficiency and innovation. But bad actors view this advancement as an expanding attack surface ripe for exploitation.

Bad actors are also leveraging the dark web. According to the IBM X-Force 2025 Threat Intelligence Index, sophisticated threat actors, including nation-states, are using the anonymity of the dark web to acquire new tools and resources.

They are demonstrating never-before-seen levels of coordination, automation and prowess—elevating risk from data breaches to widescale disruption.</p>
<h3>What are the most common types of cyber threats? </h3>
<p>Today, the most common types of cyberattacks and cybersecurity threats include:
    <br>- Malware
    <br>- Ransomware
    <br>- Phishing attacks
    <br>- Credential theft and abuse
    <br>- Insider threats
    <br>- AI attacks
    <br>- Cryptojacking
    <br>- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Best practices for cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Adopting best practices for cybersecurity can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks. 
<br><br><b>Here are three key practices:</b>

    <br>1.Regular software and operating system updates
    <br>Updating software and operating systems regularly helps to patch vulnerabilities and enhance security measures against potential threats.
    
    <br>2.Using strong and unique passwords
    <br>Creating strong and unique passwords for each online account can enhance cybersecurity, as cyberattacks often exploit weak or stolen passwords.
    
    <br>3.Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    <br>Multi-factor authentication involves multiple identification forms before account access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Cisco Duo includes MFA that can integrate with most major applications as well as custom apps.

<br><br>Following these practices enhances cybersecurity and protects digital assets. It's vital to stay vigilant and informed about the latest threats and security measures to stay ahead of cybercriminals.</p>
